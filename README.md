Create a wireframe which showcases some extra features you might want to include in
this project in the future!

I would suggest to create daskbboard which allow user to have accessability to all tables in databases. we could have controller to create new teacher , the teacher will have class that she/he was assigned in classes table, each classes have list of students who registered in that class. IF the classes was cancelled , the teacher will be deleted , and list of student who registed also must be deleted.
